 Cymata - v1
 
 Assembled by Matt Schroeter as part of Art Not Ads - artnotads.org
 
 May, 2013
 
 This release uses these libraries: Hemesh for 3D visualization, Minim for sound analysis, and Nervous System's OBJ export.
 The sound analysis is working live off of an imported file - can be configured to respond to line-in. 
 
 Pressing 'k' plays the sound file.
 
 Still experimenting with configuring hemesh and exporting 3D files. Will be adding some interface elements in the near future.
